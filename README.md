# [Project 1: KPMG Virtual Internship ](https://github.com/Sumanth3493/KPMG-Virtual-Internship)
I successfully Completed the Internship program with KPMG Virtually. It was a tremendous experience where my python, data visulaization and advanced excel skills were tested.In this internships tasks were assigned by a tutor and I successfully completed these tasks?( total of 3 tasks). Once I submit my answers it is reviewd by my supervisor at KPMG and feedback is shared along with the model answers. I worked on various data science methadologies, namely : Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights, Data Insights and Presentation

# [Project 2: Neural Networks using Python](https://github.com/Sumanth3493/Neural-Networks-using-Python) 
In this Project I have created Neural Networks using Python. This was my project in the 3rd semester of studies. I performed a number of operations, they are :Take inputs,Add bias (if required), Assign random weights to input features,Run the code for training, Find the error in prediction, Update the weight by gradient descent algorithm, Repeat the training phase with updated weights, Make predictions

# [Project 3: Supervised Learning using Python](https://github.com/Sumanth3493/Project-to-Demonstrate-Supervised-Learning-using-Python)
Supervised Learning using Python In this projected I applied supervised learning algorithms to test and train a ML model. I followed rigorous steps. some of which are Define Problem,Prepare Data, Evaluate Algorithms, Improve Results, Present Results.

# [Project 4: Demonstrating Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/Sumanth3493/Project-to-Demonstrate-Natural-Language-Processing-using-Python)
In this Project I demonstrate the Natual Language processing on the application of the following steps :lexical (structure) analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis. Some well-known application areas of NLP are Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, and Chatbots

# [Project 5: Python Project to demonstrate AND-and-OR-Functions and draw activation functions](https://github.com/Sumanth3493/Python-Project-to-demonstrate-AND-and-OR-functions-and-draw-Activation-Functions)
This was another academic Project which I pursued in my 3rd semester to draw activation functions upon the demonstration of AND-and-OR functions

# [Project 6: Tableau-Desktop-Project](https://github.com/Sumanth3493/Tableau-Desktop-Project)
This was a data visualization Project where I worked on Demonstration of data collection, cleaning and visualization on Tableau Desktop. An Existing Data Set was shared by the professor and I had to extract, visualize and display data on the Tableau Interface.
